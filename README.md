# Tron: Application of Search Algorithms

This is a project completed for CS1410: Artificial Intelligence. I collaborated with Benjamin Shih.

Tron is a 2-player game. It is essentially two player snake where two players try to survive as long as possible in an arena. You can consult the video to get a better idea of what the gameplay looks like.

Some ideas explored in this project were search algorithms such as alpha beta search with and without cutoff, adversarial search, and A* Search.
